## Recommended Release Process

### Step 1: Version Bump
```bash
npm run version
# This will update version to 1.0.0 based on changeset
```

### Step 2: Review CHANGELOG
- Verify generated CHANGELOG.md content
- Ensure all changes are documented

### Step 3: Merge and Release
- Merge PR to main branch
- Release workflow will automatically:
  - Build the package
  - Publish to npm registry
  - Create GitHub release

---

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Immediate Actions (First Week)
1. Monitor npm download statistics
2. Watch for GitHub issues/bug reports
3. Check for security vulnerability reports
4. Monitor CI/CD pipeline health

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. Respond to security issues within 24-72 hours
2. Maintain backward compatibility in minor versions
3. Provide deprecation warnings before breaking changes
4. Keep dependencies updated
5. Maintain test coverage above 95%

---

## Known Limitations

*These are design constraints, not defects:*

1. **Maximum Length Field**: 126 bytes (BER/DER specification limit)
2. **Indefinite Length**: Not supported (DER requirement)
3. **Memory Usage**: Large TLV structures require significant memory
4. **Node.js Only**: Not designed for browser environments

All limitations are documented in README and changeset.
